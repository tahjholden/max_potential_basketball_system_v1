      <div className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Dillon is a high-energy, instinct-driven mover whose game is built around speed and disruption.
        He thrives in transition but lacks pacing control, spatial sensitivity, and motor solutions under pressure.
        His athleticism and quick decision-making make him effective in open space, but he needs to develop
        better control and awareness in structured situations.
